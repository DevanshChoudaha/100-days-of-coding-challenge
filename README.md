This is where I keep my code submitted for "100 days of coding challenge".

Problem-1: 

Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers. 
Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

For example :
array [ 1,2,3,4,5] 
So now our 
minimum sum = 1+2+3+4 =>10  
maximum sum=>2+3+4+5 =>14 

so output of program : 10 14
